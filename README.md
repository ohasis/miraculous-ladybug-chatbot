This chatbot was created over the course of five weeks while I was taking the course **MAE 8: Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 8: Introduction to MATLAB**.

They reflect the knowledge learned as part of this course, including:

* Data Plotting
* Function Creation
* Matrix Manipulation

The subject for this chatbot is the French animated television show *Miraculous Ladybug: Tales of Ladybug and Chat Noir*, which was a special interest of mine in 2021.
